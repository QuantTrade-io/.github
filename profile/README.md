## About
Fascinated by the financial markets, people tend to open multiple accounts on the same or different brokers. 
Managing them all separately, from different Applications can be a real hassle.

With QuantTrade, we would like to provide every person with an easy-to-use tool, where they are able to manage all their different trading accounts. 
Having an overview of a stock broker like Interactive Brokers

We would like to extend the application with much more tools, tools that will help you as a trader or investor.
